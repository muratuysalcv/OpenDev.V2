# OpenDev.V2

With the know-how acquired, it will be operational in a short time with the power of .NET Core by taking advantage of the existing OpenDev V1 codes.

Thanks to .NET Core, the database-independent OpenDev platform will be free from IIS dependency and can be used on any PC in the world. Work continues on another GIT. The features of the version available here are as follows.

Dynamic API Supported Request/Response System
Automatic API creation support is provided for any table via database connection.

Coding Editor Module Implementation
The code development module was integrated with AJAX to make it run faster.

Database Dynamic CRUD Page Support
It connects to multiple database types in a single application and dynamically prepares CRUD pages.

W2UI Interface Design Implementation
With its very advanced modular design interface, screen usage will become much easier.

Dynamic Multi-Server Based Operation Support
With the IP information of the server on which an app will run, the entire system can transfer its entire load to the other server with exactly the same dynamic features. It provides cloud-based flexibility for Load Balancing.
